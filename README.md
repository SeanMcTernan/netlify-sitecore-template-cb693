# XM Cloud Next.js Starter Kit
This repository contains the Next.js Starter Kit for Sitecore XM Cloud Development. It is intended to get developers up and running quickly with a new Next.js project that is integrated with Sitecore XM Cloud.

## GitHub Template
This Github repository is a template that can be used to create your own repository. To get started, click the `Use this template` button at the top of the repository. 

### Prerequisites
- Access to an Sitecore XM Cloud Environment
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Getting Started Guide
For developers new to XM Cloud you can follow the Getting Started Guide on the [Sitecore Documentation Site](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc) to get up and running with XM Cloud. This will walk you through the process of creating a new XM Cloud Project, provisioning an Environment, deploying the NextJs Starter Kit, and finally creating your first Component.

### Running the Next.js Starter Kit
- Log into the Sitecore XM Cloud Deploy Portal, locate your Environment and select the `Developer Settings` tab.
- Ensure that the `Preview` toggle is enabled.
- In the `Local Development` section, click to copy the sample `.env` file contents to your clipboard.
- Create a new `.env.local` file in the `./headapps/nextjs-starter` folder of this repository and paste the contents from your clipboard.
- Run the following commands in the root of the repository to start the NextJs application:
    ```bash
    cd headapps/nextjs-starter
    npm install
    npm run start:connected
    ```
- You should now be able to access your site on `http://localhost:3000` and see your changes in real-time as you make them.

## Disconnected offline development
It is possible to mock a small subset of the XM Cloud Application elements to enable offline development. This can allow for a disconnected development experience, however it is recommend to work in the default connected mode.

You can find more information about how setup the offline development experience [here](./local-containers/README.md)
